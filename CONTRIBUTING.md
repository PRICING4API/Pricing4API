# Contributing to Pricing4API

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Pricing4API! We value everyone's contributions, whether they are bug fixes, documentation improvements, or new features. Please follow these guidelines to contribute effectively.

## Style Guide for the Code

To maintain the quality and consistency of the codebase, we ask all contributors to follow the [Google Style Guide for Python](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). Please review this guide before you start writing code.

## Branching Strategy

When contributing, it is important to create a separate branch for each feature or bug fix. This allows the library maintainers to review and test your changes independently. Our branching strategy follows the Gitflow workflow:

1. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch from the `main` branch for each feature or bug fix you are working on. Name the branch descriptively, such as `feature/new-feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-description`.
    ```sh
    git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
    ```

2. **Work on the Branch**: Make your changes in this branch and commit them with clear and descriptive messages.
    ```sh
    git commit -m "Add new feature: description of feature"
    ```

3. **Push the Branch**: Push the branch to the repository on GitHub.
    ```sh
    git push origin feature/new-feature-name
    ```

4. **Open a Pull Request**: Once your changes are ready, open a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch. Provide a detailed description of your changes and any related issue numbers.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are also welcome. Open an issue on GitHub to discuss your ideas with the project maintainers.

## Questions or Comments

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to open an issue or contact the maintainers directly.

We appreciate your contribution to Pricing4API!
